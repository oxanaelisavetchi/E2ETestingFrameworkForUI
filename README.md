### Git Workflow Guidelines
1. **Branch commits:**
On feature branches, you may make as many commits as needed.

2. **Pull Request (PR) rule:**
Before merging a PR into main or develop, the branch must be squashed to a single commit.

> Use GitHub's "Squash and Merge" or squash manually:
   ```bash
      git rebase -i origin/main
   ```

3. **README must reflect folder changes:**
If any folder structure changes are made, the README.md file must be updated accordingly with:
* New folder purpose/description
* Updated structure tree

---

* Playwright setup logic should be in:
framework.core (inside src/main if modularized, otherwise in hooks/ or utilities/)
